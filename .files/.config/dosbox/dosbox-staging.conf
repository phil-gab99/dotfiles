#          fullscreen: Start directly in fullscreen (disabled by default).
#                      Run INTRO and see Special Keys for window control hotkeys.
#             display: Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings (0 by default).
#      fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
#                      or a fixed size, e.g. 1024x768 ('desktop' by default).
#    windowresolution: Set intial window size for windowed mode. You can still resize the window
#                      after startup.
#                        default:   Select the best option based on your environment and other
#                                   settings (such as whether aspect ratio correction is enabled).
#                        small, medium, large (s, m, l):
#                                   Size the window relative to the desktop.
#                        WxH:       Specify window size in WxH format in logical units
#                                   (e.g., 1024x768).
#     window_position: Set initial window position for windowed mode:
#                        auto:      Let the window manager decide the position (default).
#                        X,Y:       Set window position in X,Y format (e.g., 250,100).
#                                   0,0 is the top-left corner of the screen.
#  window_decorations: Enable window decorations in windowed mode (enabled by default).
#        transparency: Set the transparency of the DOSBox Staging screen (0 by default).
#                      From 0 (no transparency) to 90 (high transparency).
#           host_rate: Set the host's refresh rate:
#                        auto:      Use SDI rates, or VRR rates when in fullscreen on a high-refresh
#                                   rate display (default).
#                        sdi:       Use serial device interface (SDI) rates, without further
#                                   adjustment.
#                        vrr:       Deduct 3 Hz from the reported rate (best practice for VRR
#                                   displays).
#                        N:         Specify custom refresh rate in Hz (decimal values are allowed;
#                                   23.000 is the allowed minimum).
#               vsync: Set the host video driver's vertical synchronization (vsync) mode:
#                        auto:      Limit vsync to beneficial cases, such as when using an
#                                   interpolating VRR display in fullscreen (default).
#                        on:        Enable vsync. This can prevent tearing in some games but will
#                                   impact performance or drop frames when the DOS rate exceeds the
#                                   host rate (e.g. 70 Hz DOS rate vs 60 Hz host rate).
#                        adaptive:  Enables vsync when the frame rate is higher than the host rate,
#                                   but disables it when the frame rate drops below the host rate.
#                                   This is a reasonable alternative on macOS instead of 'on'.
#                                   Note: only valid in OpenGL output modes; otherwise treated as
#                                   'on'.
#                        off:       Attempt to disable vsync to allow quicker frame presentation at
#                                   the risk of tearing in some games.
#                        yield:     Let the host's video driver control video synchronization.
#                      Possible values: auto, on, adaptive, off, yield.
#          vsync_skip: Number of microseconds to allow rendering to block before skipping the
#                      next frame. For example, a value of 7000 is roughly half the frame time
#                      at 70 Hz. 0 disables this and will always render (default).
#   presentation_mode: Select the frame presentation mode:
#                        auto:  Intelligently time and drop frames to prevent emulation stalls,
#                               based on host and DOS frame rates (default).
#                        cfr:   Always present DOS frames at a constant frame rate.
#                        vfr:   Always present changed DOS frames at a variable frame rate.
#                      Possible values: auto, cfr, vfr.
#              output: Video system to use for output ('opengl' by default).
#                      'texture' and 'opengl' use bilinear interpolation, 'texturenb' and
#                      'openglnb' use nearest-neighbour (no-bilinear). Some shaders require
#                      bilinear interpolation, making that the safest choice.
#                      Possible values: texture, texturenb, opengl, openglnb.
#                      Deprecated values: openglpp, surface, texturepp.
#    texture_renderer: Render driver to use in 'texture' output mode ('auto' by default).
#                      Use 'texture_renderer = auto' for an automatic choice.
#                      Possible values: auto, opengl, opengles2, software.
#         waitonerror: Keep the console open if an error has occurred (enabled by default).
#            priority: Priority levels to apply when active and inactive, respectively.
#                      ('auto auto' by default)
#                      'auto' lets the host operating system manage the priority.
#                      Possible values: auto, lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest.
#  mute_when_inactive: Mute the sound when the window is inactive (disabled by default).
# pause_when_inactive: Pause emulation when the window is inactive (disabled by default).
#          mapperfile: Path to the mapper file ('mapper-sdl2-XYZ.map' by default, where XYZ is the
#                      current version). Pre-configured maps are bundled in 'resources/mapperfiles'.
#                      These can be loaded by name, e.g., with 'mapperfile = xbox/xenon2.map'.
#                      Note: The '--resetmapper' command line option only deletes the default mapper
#                            file.
#         screensaver: Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER environment
#                      variable which usually blocks the OS screensaver while the emulator is
#                      running ('auto' by default).
#                      Possible values: auto, allow, block.

#                                svga_paradise:  Paradise PVGA1A SVGA card (no VESA VBE; 512K vmem by default,
#                                                can be set to 256K or 1MB with 'vmemsize'). This is the
#                                                closest to IBM's original VGA adapter.
#                                svga_et3000:    Tseng Labs ET3000 SVGA card (no VESA VBE; fixed 512K vmem).

#                                vesa_oldvbe:    Same as 'svga_s3' but limited to VESA VBE 1.2.
#                                vesa_nolfb:     Same as 'svga_s3' (VESA VBE 2.0), plus the "no linear
#                                                framebuffer" hack (needed only by a few games).
#                              Possible values: hercules, cga_mono, cga, pcjr, tandy, ega, svga_s3, svga_et3000, svga_et4000, svga_paradise, vesa_nolfb, vesa_oldvbe.
#                              Deprecated values: vgaonly.
#                     memsize: Amount of memory of the emulated machine has in MB (16 by default).
#                              Best leave at the default setting to avoid problems with some games,
#                              though a few games might require a higher value.
#                              There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
#          mcb_fault_strategy: How software-corrupted memory chain blocks should be handled:
#                                repair:  Repair (and report) faults using adjacent blocks (default).
#                                report:  Report faults but otherwise proceed as-is.
#                                allow:   Allow faults to go unreported (hardware behavior).
#                                deny:    Quit (and report) when faults are detected.
#                              Possible values: repair, report, allow, deny.
#                    vmemsize: Video memory in MB (1-8) or KB (256 to 8192). 'auto' uses the default for
#                              the selected video adapter ('auto' by default). See the 'machine' setting for
#                              the list of valid options per adapter.
#                              Possible values: auto, 1, 2, 4, 8, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.
#                    dos_rate: Customize the emulated video mode's frame rate, in Hz:
#                                default:  The DOS video mode determines the rate (recommended; default).
#                                host:     Match the DOS rate to the host rate (see 'host_rate' setting).
#                                <value>:  Sets the rate to an exact value, between 24.000 and 1000.000 (Hz).
#                              We recommend the 'default' rate; otherwise test and set on a per-game basis.
#                  vesa_modes: Controls the selection of VESA 1.2 and 2.0 modes offered:
#                                compatible:  A tailored selection that maximizes game compatibility.
#                                             This is recommended along with 4 or 8 MB of video memory
#                                             (default).
#                                halfline:    Supports the low-resolution halfline VESA 2.0 mode used by
#                                             Extreme Assault. Use only if needed, as it's not S3 compatible.
#                                all:         All modes for a given video memory size, however some games
#                                             may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
#                                             more system memory to use them.
#                              Possible values: compatible, all, halfline.
#               vga_8dot_font: Use 8-pixel-wide fonts on VGA adapters (disabled by default).
#                  speed_mods: Permit changes known to improve performance (enabled by default).
#                              Currently, no games are known to be negatively affected by this.
#                              Please file a bug with the project if you find a game that fails
#                              when this is enabled so we will list them here.
#            autoexec_section: How autoexec sections are handled from multiple config files:
#                                join:       Combine them into one big section (legacy behavior; default).
#                                overwrite:  Use the last one encountered, like other config settings.
#                              Possible values: join, overwrite.
#                   automount: Mount 'drives/[c]' directories as drives on startup, where [c] is a lower-case
#                              drive letter from 'a' to 'y' (enabled by default). The 'drives' folder can be
#                              provided relative to the current directory or via built-in resources.
#                              Mount settings can be optionally provided using a [c].conf file along-side
#                              the drive's directory, with content as follows:
#                                [drive]
#                                type    = dir, overlay, floppy, or cdrom
#                                label   = custom_label
#                                path    = path-specification, ie: path = %%path%%;c:\tools
#                                override_drive = mount the directory to this drive instead (default empty)
#                                verbose = true or false
#           startup_verbosity: Controls verbosity prior to displaying the program ('auto' by default):
#                                Verbosity   | Welcome | Early stdout
#                                high        |   yes   |    yes
#                                low         |   no    |    yes
#                                quiet       |   no    |    no
#                                auto        | 'low' if exec or dir is passed, otherwise 'high'
#                              Possible values: auto, high, low, quiet.
# allow_write_protected_files: Many games open all their files with writable permissions; even files that they
#                              never modify. This setting lets you write-protect those files while still
#                              allowing the game to read them (enabled by default). A second use-case: if
#                              you're using a copy-on-write or network-based filesystem, this setting avoids
#                              triggering write operations for these write-protected files.

#                                            are displayed with square pixels. Most 320x200 games
#                                            will appear squashed, but a minority of titles (e.g.,
#                                            DOS ports of PAL Amiga games) need square pixels to
#                                            appear as the artists intended.
#                       stretch:             Calculate the aspect ratio from the viewport's
#                                            dimensions. Combined with 'viewport', this mode is
#                                            useful to force arbitrary aspect ratios (e.g.,
#                                            stretching DOS games to fullscreen on 16:9 displays) and
#                                            to emulate the horizontal and vertical stretch controls
#                                            of CRT monitors.
#                     Possible values: auto, on, square-pixels, off, stretch.
#    integer_scaling: Constrain the horizontal or vertical scaling factor to the largest integer
#                     value so the image still fits into the viewport. The configured aspect ratio is
#                     always maintained according to the 'aspect' and 'viewport' settings, which may
#                     result in a non-integer scaling factor in the other dimension. If the image is
#                     larger than the viewport, the integer scaling constraint is auto-disabled (same
#                     as 'off'). Possible values:
#                       auto:        'vertical' mode auto-enabled for adaptive CRT shaders only
#                                    (see 'glshader'), otherwise 'off' (default).
#                       vertical:    Constrain the vertical scaling factor to integer values.
#                                    This is the recommended setting for CRT shaders to avoid uneven
#                                    scanlines and interference artifacts.
#                       horizontal:  Constrain the horizontal scaling factor to integer values.
#                       off:         No integer scaling constraint is applied; the image fills the
#                                    viewport while maintaining the configured aspect ratio.
#                     Possible values: auto, vertical, horizontal, off.
#           viewport: Set the viewport size (maximum drawable area). The video output is always
#                     contained within the viewport while taking the configured aspect ratio into
#                     account (see 'aspect'). Possible values:
#                       fit:             Fit the viewport into the available window/screen (default).
#                                        There might be padding (black areas) around the image with
#                                        'integer_scaling' enabled.
#                       WxH:             Set a fixed viewport size in WxH format in logical units
#                                        (e.g., 960x720). The specified size must not be larger than
#                                        the desktop. If it's larger than the window size, it's
#                                        scaled to fit within the window.
#                       N%:              Similar to 'WxH' but the size is specified as a percentage
#                                        of the desktop size.
#                       relative H% V%:  The viewport is set to a 4:3 aspect ratio rectangle fit into
#                                        the available window/screen, then it's scaled by the H and V
#                                        horizontal and vertical scaling factors (valid range is from
#                                        20% to 300%). The resulting viewport is allowed to extend
#                                        beyond the window/screen. Useful to force arbitrary display
#                                        aspect ratios with 'aspect = stretch' and to zoom into the
#                                        image. This effectively emulates the horizontal and vertical
#                                        stretch controls of CRT monitors.
#                     Notes:
#                       - Using 'relative' mode with 'integer_scaling' enabled could lead to
#                         surprising (but correct) results.
#                       - You can use the 'Stretch Axis', 'Inc Stretch', and 'Dec Stretch' hotkey
#                         actions to set the stretch in 'relative' mode in real-time.
# monochrome_palette: Set the palette for monochrome display emulation ('amber' by default).
#                     Works only with the 'hercules' and 'cga_mono' machine types.
#                     Note: You can also cycle through the available palettes via hotkeys.
#                     Possible values: amber, green, white, paperwhite.
#         cga_colors: Set the interpretation of CGA RGBI colours. Affects all machine types capable
#                     of displaying CGA or better graphics. Built-in presets:
#                       default:       The canonical CGA palette, as emulated by VGA adapters
#                                      (default).
#                       tandy <bl>:    Emulation of an idealised Tandy monitor with adjustable brown
#                                      level. The brown level can be provided as an optional second
#                                      parameter (0 - red, 50 - brown, 100 - dark yellow;
#                                      defaults to 50). E.g. tandy 100
#                       tandy-warm:    Emulation of the actual colour output of an unknown Tandy
#                                      monitor.

#                                      with a unique contrast control that dims non-bright colours
#                                      only. The contrast can be optionally provided as a second
#                                      parameter (0 to 100; defaults to 100), e.g. ibm5153 60
#                       agi-amiga-v1, agi-amiga-v2, agi-amiga-v3:
#                                      Palettes used by the Amiga ports of Sierra AGI games.
#                       agi-amigaish:  A mix of EGA and Amiga colours used by the Sarien
#                                      AGI-interpreter.
#                       scumm-amiga:   Palette used by the Amiga ports of LucasArts EGA games.

#                       dga16:         A modern take on the canonical CGA palette with dialed back
#                                      contrast.
#                     You can also set custom colours by specifying 16 space or comma separated
#                     colour values, either as 3 or 6-digit hex codes (e.g. #f00 or #ff0000 for full
#                     red), or decimal RGB triplets (e.g. (255, 0, 255) for magenta). The 16 colours
#                     are ordered as follows:
#                       black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light-grey, dark-grey,
#                       light-blue, light-green, light-cyan, light-red, light-magenta, yellow, white.

#                       #000000 #0000aa #00aa00 #00aaaa #aa0000 #aa00aa #aa5500 #aaaaaa
#                       #555555 #5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 #ffffff
#           glshader: Set an adaptive CRT monitor emulation shader or a regular GLSL shader in OpenGL
#                     output modes. Adaptive CRT shader options:
#                       crt-auto:               A CRT shader that prioritises developer intent and
#                                               how people experienced the game at the time of
#                                               release (default). The appropriate shader variant is
#                                               automatically selected based the graphics standard of
#                                               the current video mode and the viewport size,
#                                               irrespective of the 'machine' setting. This means
#                                               that even on an emulated VGA card you'll get
#                                               authentic single-scanned EGA monitor emulation with
#                                               visible "thick scanlines" in EGA games.
#                       crt-auto-machine:       Similar to 'crt-auto', but this picks a fixed CRT
#                                               monitor appropriate for the video adapter configured
#                                               via the 'machine' setting. E.g., CGA and EGA games
#                                               will appear double-scanned on an emulated VGA
#                                               adapter.
#                       crt-auto-arcade:        Emulation of an arcade or home computer monitor less
#                                               sharp than a typical PC monitor with thick scanlines
#                                               in low-resolution modes. This fantasy option does not
#                                               exist in real life, but it can be a lot of fun,
#                                               especially with DOS ports of Amiga games.
#                       crt-auto-arcade-sharp:  A sharper variant of the arcade shader for those who
#                                               like the thick scanlines but want to retain the
#                                               horizontal sharpness of a typical PC monitor.
#                     Other options include 'sharp', 'none', a shader listed using the
#                     '--list-glshaders' command-line argument, or an absolute or relative path

#                   capture_dir: Directory where the various captures are saved, such as audio, video, MIDI
#                                and screenshot captures. ('capture' in the current working directory by
#                                default).
# default_image_capture_formats: Set the capture format of the default screenshot action ('upscaled' by
#                                default):
#                                  upscaled:  The image is bilinear-sharp upscaled and the correct aspect
#                                             ratio is maintained, depending on the 'aspect' setting. The
#                                             vertical scaling factor is always an integer. For example,
#                                             320x200 content is upscaled to 1600x1200 (5:6 integer scaling),
#                                             640x480 to 1920x1440 (3:3 integer scaling), and 640x350 to
#                                             1400x1050 (2.1875:3 scaling; fractional horizontally and
#                                             integer vertically). The filenames of upscaled screenshots
#                                             have no postfix (e.g. 'image0001.png').
#                                  rendered:  The post-rendered, post-shader image shown on the screen is
#                                             captured. The filenames of rendered screenshots end with
#                                             '-rendered' (e.g. 'image0001-rendered.png').
#                                  raw:       The contents of the raw framebuffer is captured (this always
#                                             results in square pixels). The filenames of raw screenshots
#                                             end with '-raw' (e.g. 'image0001-raw.png').
#                                If multiple formats are specified separated by spaces, the default
#                                screenshot action will save multiple images in the specified formats.
#                                Keybindings for taking single screenshots in specific formats are also
#                                available.

[mouse]
#             mouse_capture: Set the mouse capture behaviour:
#                              onclick:   Capture the mouse when clicking any mouse button in the window
#                                         (default).
#                              onstart:   Capture the mouse immediately on start. Might not work correctly
#                                         on some host operating systems.
#                              seamless:  Let the mouse move seamlessly between the DOSBox window and the
#                                         rest of the desktop; captures only with middle-click or hotkey.
#                                         Seamless mouse does not work correctly with all the games.
#                                         Windows 3.1x can be made compatible with a custom mouse driver.
#                              nomouse:   Hide the mouse and don't send mouse input to the game.
#                            For touch-screen control, use 'seamless'.
#                            Possible values: seamless, onclick, onstart, nomouse.
#      mouse_middle_release: Release the captured mouse by middle-clicking, and also capture it in
#                            seamless mode (enabled by default).
# mouse_multi_display_aware: Allow seamless mouse behavior and mouse pointer release to work in fullscreen
#                            mode on systems with more than one display (enabled by default).
#                            Note: You should disable this if it incorrectly detects multiple displays
#                                  when only one should actually be used. This might happen if you are
#                                  using mirrored display mode or using an AV receiver's HDMI input for
#                                  audio-only listening.
#         mouse_sensitivity: Global mouse sensitivity for the horizontal and vertical axes, as a percentage
#                            (100 by default). Values can be separated by spaces, commas, or semicolons
#                            (i.e. 100,150). Negative values invert the axis, zero disables it.
#                            Providing only one value sets sensitivity for both axes.
#                            Sensitivity can be further fine-tuned per mouse interface using the internal
#                            MOUSECTL.COM tool available on the Z drive.
#           mouse_raw_input: Enable to bypass your operating system's mouse acceleration and sensitivity
#                            settings (enabled by default). Works in fullscreen or when the mouse is
#                            captured in windowed mode.
#          dos_mouse_driver: Enable built-in DOS mouse driver (enabled by default).
#                            Notes:
#                              - Disable if you intend to use original MOUSE.COM driver in emulated DOS.
#                              - When guest OS is booted, built-in driver gets disabled automatically.
#       dos_mouse_immediate: Update mouse movement counters immediately, without waiting for interrupt
#                            (disabled by default). May improve gameplay, especially in fast-paced games
#                            (arcade, FPS, etc.), as for some games it effectively boosts the mouse
#                            sampling rate to 1000 Hz, without increasing interrupt overhead.
#                            Might cause compatibility issues. List of known incompatible games:

[mixer]
#    nosound: Enable silent mode (disabled by default).
#             Sound is still fully emulated in silent mode, but DOSBox outputs silence.
#       rate: Mixer sample rate (48000 by default).
#             Possible values: 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 32000, 44100, 48000.
#  blocksize: Mixer block size in sample frames (512 by default). Larger values might help
#             with sound stuttering but the sound will also be more lagged.
#             Possible values: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.
#  prebuffer: How many milliseconds of sound to render on top of the blocksize
#             (20 by default). Larger values might help with sound stuttering but the sound
#             will also be more lagged.
#  negotiate: Let the system audio driver negotiate possibly better sample rate and blocksize
#             settings (enabled by default).
# compressor: Enable the auto-leveling compressor on the master channel to prevent clipping
#             of the audio output:
#               off:  Disable compressor.
#               on:   Enable compressor (default).
#  crossfeed: Enable crossfeed globally on all stereo channels for headphone listening:
#               off:     No crossfeed (default).
#               on:      Enable crossfeed (normal preset).
#               light:   Light crossfeed (strength 15).
#               normal:  Normal crossfeed (strength 40).
#               strong:  Strong crossfeed (strength 65).
#             Note: You can fine-tune each channel's crossfeed strength using the MIXER.
#             Possible values: off, on, light, normal, strong.
#     reverb: Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:
#               off:     No reverb (default).
#               on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
#               tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
#                        specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
#                        (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).
#               small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
#                        synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
#               medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
#               large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
#                        channels for music and digital audio.
#               huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
#                        in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.
#             Note: You can fine-tune each channel's reverb level using the MIXER.
#             Possible values: off, on, tiny, small, medium, large, huge.
#     chorus: Enable chorus globally to add a sense of stereo movement to the sound:
#               off:     No chorus (default).
#               on:      Enable chorus (normal preset).
#               light:   A light chorus effect (especially suited for synth music that
#                        features lots of white noise).
#               normal:  Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.
#               strong:  An obvious and upfront chorus effect.
#             Note: You can fine-tune each channel's chorus level using the MIXER.
#             Possible values: off, on, light, normal, strong.

[midi]
#      mididevice: Set where MIDI data from the emulated MPU-401 MIDI interface is sent
#                  ('auto' by default):
#                    oss:         Use the Linux OSS MIDI playback interface.
#                    alsa:        Use the Linux ALSA MIDI playback interface.
#                    fluidsynth:  The built-in FluidSynth MIDI synthesizer (SoundFont player).
#                                 See the [fluidsynth] section for detailed configuration.
#                    auto:        Either one of the built-in MIDI synthesisers (if `midiconfig` is
#                                 set to 'fluidsynth' or 'mt32'), or a MIDI device external to
#                                 DOSBox (any other 'midiconfig' value). This might be a software
#                                 synthesizer or physical device. This is the default behaviour.
#                    none:        Disable MIDI output.
#                  Possible values: auto, oss, alsa, fluidsynth, none.
#      midiconfig: Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface (unset by default).
#                  This is usually the ID or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
#                  to use (find the ID/name with the DOS command 'MIXER /LISTMIDI').
#                  Notes:
#                    - This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
#                      ('mididevice = fluidsynth' or 'mididevice = mt32').
#                    - When using ALSA, use the Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list all open
#                      MIDI ports and select one (e.g. 'midiconfig = 14:0' for sequencer
#                      client 14, port 0).
#                    - If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB, the hardware
#                      may require a delay in order to prevent its buffer from overflowing.
#                      In that case, add 'delaysysex' (e.g. 'midiconfig = 2 delaysysex').
#          mpu401: MPU-401 mode to emulate ('intelligent' by default).
#                  Possible values: intelligent, uart, none.
# raw_midi_output: Enable raw, unaltered MIDI output (disabled by default).
#                  The MIDI drivers of many games don't fully conform to the MIDI standard,
#                  which makes editing the MIDI recordings of these games very error-prone and
#                  cumbersome in MIDI sequencers, often resulting in hanging or missing notes.
#                  DOSBox corrects the MIDI output of such games by default. This results in no
#                  audible difference whatsoever; it only affects the representation of the MIDI
#                  data. You should only enable 'raw_midi_output' if you really need to capture
#                  the raw, unaltered MIDI output of a program, e.g. when working with music
#                  applications, or when debugging MIDI issues.

[fluidsynth]
#     soundfont: Path to a SoundFont file in .sf2 format ('default.sf2' by default).
#                You can use an absolute or relative path, or the name of an .sf2 inside the
#                'soundfonts' directory within your DOSBox configuration directory.
#                An optional percentage value after the name will scale the SoundFont's volume.
#                This is useful for normalising the volume of different SoundFonts.
#                E.g. 'my_soundfont.sf2 50' will attenuate the volume by 50%.
#                The percentage value can range from 1 to 800.
# fsynth_chorus: Chorus effect: 'auto' (default), 'on', 'off', or custom values.
#                When using custom values:
#                  All five must be provided in-order and space-separated.
#                  They are: voice-count level speed depth modulation-wave, where:
#                    - voice-count is an integer from 0 to 99
#                    - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
#                    - speed is a decimal, measured in Hz, from 0.1 to 5.0
#                    - depth is a decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
#                    - modulation-wave is either 'sine' or 'triangle'
#                  For example: chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine
#                Note: You can disable the FluidSynth chorus and enable the mixer-level chorus
#                      on the FluidSynth channel instead, or enable both chorus effects at the
#                      same time. Whether this sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the
#                      chorus settings being used.
# fsynth_reverb: Reverb effect: 'auto' (default), 'on', 'off', or custom values.
#                When using custom values:
#                  All four must be provided in-order and space-separated.
#                  They are: room-size damping width level, where:

#                                ch:        Emulate joystick as an original CH Flightstick.
#                                hidden:    Prevent DOS from seeing the joystick(s), but enable them
#                                           for mapping.
#                                disabled:  Fully disable joysticks: won't be polled, mapped,
#                                           or visible in DOS.
#                              Remember to reset DOSBox's mapperfile if you saved it earlier.
#                              Possible values: auto, 2axis, 4axis, 4axis_2, fcs, ch, hidden, disabled.
#                       timed: Enable timed intervals for axis (enabled by default).
#                              Experiment with this option, if your joystick drifts away.
#                    autofire: Fire continuously as long as the button is pressed

#                              Can be useful for certain joysticks.
#                  buttonwrap: Enable button wrapping at the number of emulated buttons (disabled by default).
#               circularinput: Enable translation of circular input to square output (disabled by default).
#                              Try enabling this if your left analog stick can only move in a circle.
#                    deadzone: Percentage of motion to ignore (10 by default).
#                              100 turns the stick into a digital one.
# use_joy_calibration_hotkeys: Enable hotkeys to allow realtime calibration of the joystick's X and Y axes
#                              (disabled by default). Only consider this if in-game calibration fails and
#                              other settings have been tried.
#                                - Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow-keys adjust the axis' scalar value:
#                                    - Left and Right diminish or magnify the x-axis scalar, respectively.
#                                    - Down and Up diminish or magnify the y-axis scalar, respectively.
#                                - Alt+Arrow-keys adjust the axis' offset position:
#                                    - Left and Right shift X-axis offset in the given direction.
#                                    - Down and Up shift the Y-axis offset in the given direction.
#                                - Reset the X and Y calibration using Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Home,
#                                  respectively.
#                              Each tap will report X or Y calibration values you can set below. When you find
#                              parameters that work, quit the game, switch this setting back to disabled, and
#                              populate the reported calibration parameters.
#           joy_x_calibration: Apply X-axis calibration parameters from the hotkeys ('auto' by default).

#                  - for 'mouse':      model (overrides the setting from the [mouse] section)
#                  - for 'direct':     realport (required), rxdelay (optional).
#                                      (e.g., realport:COM1, realport:ttyS0).
#                  - for 'modem':      listenport, sock, bps (all optional).

#                The 'sock' parameter specifies the protocol to use at both sides of the
#                connection. Valid values are 0 for TCP, and 1 for ENet reliable UDP.
#                Example: serial1=modem listenport:5000 sock:1

#                        Common settings are 3.3, 5.0, 6.22, and 7.1.
#         locale_period: Set locale epoch ('modern' by default). Historic settings (if available
#                        for the given country) try to mimic old DOS behaviour when displaying
#                        information such as dates, time, or numbers, modern ones follow current day
#                        practices for user experience more consistent with typical host systems.
#                        Possible values: historic, modern.
#               country: Set DOS country code ('auto' by default).
#                        This affects country-specific information such as date, time, and decimal
#                        formats. The list of supported country codes can be displayed using

#                        corresponding to the selected keyboard layout will be used.
#        keyboardlayout: Language code of the keyboard layout, or 'auto' ('auto' by default).
# expand_shell_variable: Enable expanding environment variables such as %PATH% in the DOS command shell
#                        (auto by default, enabled if DOS version >= 7.0).
#                        FreeDOS and MS-DOS 7/8 COMMAND.COM supports this behavior.

#     setver_table_file: File containing the list of applications and assigned DOS versions, in a
#                        tab-separated format, used by SETVER.EXE as a persistent storage
#                        (empty by default).

#            ne2000: Enable emulation of a Novell NE2000 network card on a software-based
#                    network (using libslirp) with properties as follows (enabled by default):
#                      - 255.255.255.0:  Subnet mask of the 10.0.2.0 virtual LAN.
#                      - 10.0.2.2:       IP of the gateway and DHCP service.
#                      - 10.0.2.3:       IP of the virtual DNS server.
#                      - 10.0.2.15:      First IP provided by DHCP, your IP!
#                    Note: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver, DHCP
#                          client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding from the host
#                          into the DOS guest, and from your router to your host when acting as the
#                          server for multiplayer games.
#           nicbase: Base address of the NE2000 card (300 by default).
#                    Note: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned to the
#                          Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound by default.
#                    Possible values: 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 2c0, 300, 320, 340, 360.
#            nicirq: The interrupt used by the NE2000 card (3 by default).
#                    Note: IRQs 3 and 5 might not be available as they're assigned to
#                          'serial2' and the Gravis UltraSound by default.
#                    Possible values: 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15.
#           macaddr: The MAC address of the NE2000 card ('AC:DE:48:88:99:AA' by default).
# tcp_port_forwards: Forward one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest
#                    (unset by default).
#                    The format is:
#                      port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
#                      This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
#                    If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
#                      host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
#                      This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest.
#                    A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
#                      start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
#                      This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
#                    Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
#                      hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
#                      This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest.
#                    Notes:
#                      - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
#                      - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
#                      - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
# udp_port_forwards: Forward one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest
#                    (unset by default). The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
