The solutions for the different parts of the assignment can all be viewed in the
LaTeX report named `report.pdf`.

For specifically viewing some of the source files used in the parts 1 and 2 of
the work, refer to the `src/` directory containing all `.smt2` files, which
contain the code for part 1 written in SMTLIBv2 format, and all `.als` files,
containing the code for part 2 in Alloy. The different `.thm` files can also be
accessed from that same directory. For part 3, the appropriate files are in the
`p3script/` directory containing the `.sh` file which holds the script for the
procedure described in part 3. The `.thm` file is the file that should be used
when visualizing the Alloy generated model. The other files are generated by
script.

For viewing the images such as the different models generated by Alloy in part
2, refer to the `img/` directory.

Note that the script for part 3 was written in bash - The gnu bash interpreter
is required for running the script (tested and working for version 5.0.17). The
tools called by the script are Alloy, Z3 and NuSMV all of which are included in
the `lib/` directory.

The source files as well as the images have also been included in the report.
