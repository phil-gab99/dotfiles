Hi,

I am Philippe, currently undertaking my bachelor's degree in computer science at the start of my last year. I had a couple of questions regarding the course.

- Firstly, for Monday classes, I am presently taking a databases course (IFT2935) and have a slight conflict in class hours. My databases course starts at 8h30 AM and ends at 10h30 AM whereas this course begins at 9h30 AM and ends at 11h30 AM. Since today we have discussed how courses will generally only take an hour, would it be possible to begin at 10h30 AM?
- Secondly, I have noticed that I am the only student still at my bachelor's degree in my academic progress. I am aware that we have discussed today the assumed background for undertaking this course and that in the majority of the highlighted points, I seem to be alright. Though I would still like to ask if there is anything in particular that I should look out for in preparation for this course.

My apologies for all these questions, this is actually the first graduated course that I am undertaking under the computer science honors program.
Thank you for your time and have a great day.

Regards,
