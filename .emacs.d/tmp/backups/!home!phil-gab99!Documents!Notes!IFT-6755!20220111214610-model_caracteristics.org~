* Purposes of Models

- *Explanatory* - Lightweight exploration of design alternatives
- *Documentation* - A descriptive model used to communicate information about the original
- *Specification* - A plan (prescriptive model) for constructing an instance of the original
- *Analysis* - Descriptive models used to evaluate or predict properties of the original
  - Ex.: differential equations
- *Educational* - A substitute for the original for ethical and practical reasons
  - Ex.: Skeletons in medical studies, flight simulators, dolls

* Types of models

- *Descriptive* vs *Prescriptive* models
  - A property of the _relationship_ between a model and an original
  - A *descriptive model* is a model where the phenomenon already exists in reality (world vs map)
  - A *prescriptive model* is created before the original is created, to help build the original

Both models are used when designing a new product or system:

- *Representative* vs *Classification* models
  - Whether model phenomena capture _singular_ ("token") original instances, or generically represent _multiple_ ("type") instances
  - Collection of descriptions on how to classifiy an object
    
- *Static* vs *Dynamic* models
  - Describes a _snapshot_ in time, or describes how the original _evolves_
  - A *static* model is a representation of a particular  point in time
  - A *dynamic* model shows how a particular system can evolve
    
- *Sketch* vs *Blueprint* vs *Executable* models
  - Level of precision of model
