* Proofs

- A sequence of statements, connected by a *logical consequence*
  - Logical consequence ($\vdash$) is different from material condition ($\to$)
  - Unfortunately, we often use the same English words for both /implies/ and /therefore/
- *Consequence* is established by following well understood rules
  - /Modus Ponens/: $((A \to B) \land A) \vdash B$
  - /DeMorgan/: $\lnot (A \land B) \vdash (\lnot A \lor \lnot B)$

** Proofs by Natural Deduction
