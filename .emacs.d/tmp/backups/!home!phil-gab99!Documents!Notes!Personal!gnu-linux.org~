  - For system management programs - Not normally used by ordinary users
  - Needed before ~/usr~ is mounted
- ~/usr/bin~
  - For distribution managed normal user programs
- ~/usr/sbin~
  - Same relation to ~/usr/bin~ as ~/sbin~ is to ~/bin~
- ~/usr/local/bin~
  - For Normal user programs *not managed* by the distribution package manager
  - This applies for locally compiled packages
  - Such packages should not be installed into ~/usr/bin~ because future distributions may modify ore delete them without warning
- ~/usr/local/sbin~
  - Same relation to ~/usr/local/bin~ as ~/usr/sbin~ is to ~/usr/bin~ and as ~/sbin~ is to ~/bin~
