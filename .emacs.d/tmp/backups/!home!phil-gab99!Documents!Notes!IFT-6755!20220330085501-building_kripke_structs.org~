* Building Krikpe structures

How fast do Krikpe structures grow?
- Composing linear number of structures yields exponential growth
- Models of size $2^{100}$ are very easy to obtain
- State explosion

How to deal with this problem?
- *Symbolic model checking* - With efficient data structures (Binary Decision trees [BDDs], SAT)
  - Do not need to represent and manipulate the entire model
- *Abstraction*
  - Abstract away variables in the model which are not relevant to the formula being checked
- *Composition*
  - Break the verification problem down into several simpler verification problems
