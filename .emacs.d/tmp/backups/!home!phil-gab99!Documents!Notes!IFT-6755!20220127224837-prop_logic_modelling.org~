* Modelling with propositional logic

Suppose we can solve the satisfiability problem - How can this help?

- There are numerous problems in the industry that are solved via the satisfiability problem of propositional logic
  - Logistics
  - Planning
  - Electronic Design Automation Industry
  - Cryptography
  - (every NP-P problem)

** Example 1 - Placement of wedding guests

- Three chairs in a row: 1, 2, 3
- We need to place Aunt, Sister and Father.
- Constraints:
  - Aunt doesn’t want to sit near Father
  - Aunt doesn’t want to sit in the left chair
  - Sister doesn’t want to sit to the right of Father

• Can we satisfy these constraints?

Denote: $\mathrm{Aunt} = 1, \quad \mathrm{Sister} = 2, \quad \mathrm{Father} = 3$
Introduce a propositional variable for each pair (person place): $x_{i, j} =$ person $i$ sitting in place $j$, for $1 \leq i, j \leq 3$

Redefine constraints:
- Aunt doesn't want to sit neat Father:
  $((x_{1,1} \lor x_{1, 3}) \to \lnot x_{3, 2}) \land (x_{1, 2} \to (\lnot x_{3, 1} \land \lnot x_{3, 3}))$
- Aunt doesn't want to sit in the left chair
  $\lnot x_{1, 1}$
- Sister doesn't want to sit to the right of the Father
  $x_{3, 1} \to \lnot x_{2,2} \land x_{3, 2} \to \lnot x_{2, 3}$

Additional constrains:
- Each person is placed:
  \begin{align*}
   (x_{1, 1} \lor x_{1, 2} \lor x_{1, 3}) & \land \\
   (x_{2, 1} \lor x_{2, 2} \lor x_{2, 3}) & \land \\
   (x_{3, 1} \lor x_{3, 2} \lor x_{3, 3}) &
  \end{align*}
   
  More concisely: $\land_{i = 1}^3 \lor_{j = 1}^3 x_{i, j}$

- No person is placed in more than one place:
