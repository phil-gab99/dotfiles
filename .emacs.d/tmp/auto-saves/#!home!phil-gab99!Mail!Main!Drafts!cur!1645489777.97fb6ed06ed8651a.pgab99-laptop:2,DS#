Hi Philippe,            

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. Thank you for the update. It's odd that you're still getting that            
response.            

I consulted with the team on this, and I'd like to take a step back and just check a couple of assumptions            
on my part. When we started you were on the firmware update from January 2022. We had an            
unrelated bug that forced us to rollback that update to a July 2022 version.            

I am now assuming, based on our previous step of reinstalling the firmware, that we are on the version            
that was rolled back. Let's check this. Please provide the output again for:            



sudo dmidecode            

I'd also like to get some information about the kernel we're running. Let's also grab the output for:            



sudo dpkg --list | grep linux-image            

and

Best,

Hi Nathaniel,            

My apologies for my late reply, I was a little busy these past couple of days.            

I have followed the article (the CLI section) and have scheduled for the firmware update and then            
rebooted my system for the update to take place. I also made sure to run these 3 commands that you            
had specified in your last email which were also mentioned in the article.. Once I started my machine            
again, I still get the same issue with the charge thresholds. I notice that at the            
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/ directory, the files charge_control_start_threshold and            
charge_control_end_threshold are still not present. Furthermore, when I run from the terminal the            
command system76-power charge-thresholds, it still shows me the message that daemon returned            
an error message: "Not running System76 firmware with charge threshold support"            

Regards,

Hello Philippe,            



Thanks for getting me that output. It looks like the system is correctly identifying the firmware. So I think            
we're okay there.            



That said, I'd still like to try reinstalling the firmware to see if that fixes the battery problem.            



We have a support article on updating/reinstalling firmware here:            

https://support.system76.com/articles/system-firmware             



Please look that entire article over as it contains important setup information, but specifically I'd like to            
run these commands:            



sudo apt update            
sudo apt install system76-firmware            
sudo system76-firmware-cli schedule            


Source: https://support.system76.com/articles/system-firmware#starting-the-update-cli             



The first command makes sure the repos are up to date. The second, makes sure that the firmware            
application is installed. The third, and final command tells the system to update/reinstall the firmware on            
the next reboot.            



Once that's done, let's try setting the battery thresholds again.            



Best,

Hi Philppe,            



Thanks for that output. It looks like the package is installed            
just fine.            



Could you also provide:            



sudo dmidecode            


Thanks!

Hello Philippe,            



Thanks for reaching out and providing that information. I'm happy to help!            



Based on your report, I touched base with our QA team and they confirmed that the January firmware            
update did not remove charging thresholds and seems to still be working in their master file on the            
Lemp 10. So it doesn't look like that firmware update in particular would have affected the charging            
thresholds.            



We are in the process of doing some firmware revisions (in fact that most recent January update has            
been rolled back).            



Let's still see if we can figure out what is happening here.            

Please the output of the Terminal command:            



apt policy system76-dkms            


Best,

Recent changes to system: Using emacs EXWM desktop session instead of the default.            

OS and version: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS            

Hi, I have bought this laptop somewhere around past mid 2021 and I have really enjoyed it so far, it has            
everything I could ever need and much more. One of the features I loved a lot about this model is that it            
supported setting one's own charging thresholds to preserve battery life. I had followed this reddit post's            
(https://www.reddit.com/r/System76/comments/kcqt9o/how_to_enable_and_control_charging_thresholds_on/)            
advice on the matter as well as an article on your website about the matter.            

Although recently I noticed these thresholds not working on my machine anymore. It was around the time I            
had installed the last firmware update which came out around 6th of January. I hadn't installed immediately            
then, but I had noticed that after I did update, the next day I started using the laptop, trying to set the            
thresholds wouldn't work anymore. And when I try to run a command using the `system76-power` package            
to change the thresholds, I receive a message that I hadn't received previously: daemon returned an error            
message: "Not running System76 firmware with charge threshold support".            

At first it didn't bother me so much, I thought I'd make do until the next firmware update where it would be            
fixed hopefully. But now I am a little worried because it has been a couple of weeks since I have not been            
using the charge threshold feature and I haven't found anything on either the GitHub repo or on reddit any            
body with a similar issue.            

Should I expect everything to be fixed by the next firmware update? Is there anything I should do now? Is            
there any other information you need me to provide?            

Thank you for your time and have nice day!
